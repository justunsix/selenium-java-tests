# Selenium Java Tests

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/justunsix/selenium-java-tests)

## About The Project

Template project to run tests with Selenium and Java.

### Built with

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Chrome driver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/getting-started)
  and Chrome browser for your platform. The driver must match with the browser
  version.
- [Java SE 10+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

## Getting Started

Get a local copy up and running by following these steps.

### Prerequisites

Choose an option below. You can develop in your browser or locally.

#### Option 1. Development Environment in Browser

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/features) is an online dev environment based on
VS Code/Theia and can launch ready-to-code development environments for GitHub
projects with a single click. It is free for open source projects like this one
and a nice way to sharing code with others. You can open
<https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/justunsix/selenium-java-tests> or push
the Gitpod ready-to-code button at the top of this README.

This option right now is only useful for development. To run the program, a
local installation is recommended since it requires a Chrome browser installed.

#### Option 2. Install Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local computer using
   `git clone https://github.com/justunsix/selenium-java-tests.git`.
2. [Install Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) -
   Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to Java folder and add the
   JDK's bin folder to your `path` environment variable.
3. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) - add Maven's bin
   folder to your `path` environment variable.
4. Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) in the default
   location and the
   [Chrome driver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/getting-started),
   making sure the versions match and add the Chrome driver binary to your
   `path` environment variable.
   [Web Driver Manager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) is an
   alternative and efficient way to manage this part; however, this repository
   does not use it as a dependency.
   1. Add the chrome driver folder to your 'path' environment variable.
   2. Open your Chrome browser to check it works. If Chrome opens up as a black
      screen
      [disable hardware acceleration using this workaround](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/17216800/completely-black-screen-when-opening-chrome?hl=en&msgid=23887976#).

### Installation and Run

Confirm installations and pathes are setup in a terminal

```sh
# Maven
mvn -v

# Java
java -version

```

Build and run the project

```sh

cd training
mvn package

# Run main method in class AppExample
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="training.AppExample"

```

After running it, Chrome will briefly open and visit
<https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/>, a site for test automation, and then
close. You will see something like below in the terminal indicating the driver
visited and got a link text meaning the run was successful.

```log
[[ChromeDriver: chrome on WINDOWS (d40a87asdas31c6a93304e19e3)] -> partial link text: Testing]
=== Test Driver Complete ===
```

## Usage

Inspect the Java model framework for <https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/> and
<https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/> and see and modify test cases for
The-Internet site.

When developing, you may want to download the dependency's source with
`mvn dependency:sources` and/or Javadocs with
`mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc`

Placeholders:

- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used.
  Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You
  may also link to more resources.
- For more examples, please refer to the Documentation

## Roadmap

- Follow course
  [Seleium Webdriver Java course](https://github.com/angiejones/selenium-webdriver-java-course)
  and try code here.

## Appendix: How this repository was set up

Initialize project in this repository's folder using a Maven quickstart template

```sh
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=training -DartifactId=training -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

Add [Selenium's dependency](https://www.selenium.dev/maven/) to Maven's pom.
Added
[Chrome driver dependency from MVN](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-chrome-driver/3.141.59)
for testing. Other WebDrivers can be added.

## Appendix: Example Windows Setup to Meet Installation Requirements

- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or
  [VS Code with Java Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)
  per VS Code Java Tutorial and
  [VS Code Java Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-linting) -
  formatter, problem and vulnerability analysis
- Install JDK (in VS Code quickstrart or separate installation like
  [JDK 64 Portable (Windows)](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/jdkportable64).
